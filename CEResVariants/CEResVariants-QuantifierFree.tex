\section{Ignoring Quantifier-Free Cuts}
\label{sec:CutEliminationByResolution:CEResIgnoringAtomicCuts}

When all that is desired is the possibility to 
summarize the proof by means of Herbrand sequents 
\cite{Paleo2007Herbrand-Sequent-Extraction,Paleo2008Herbrand-Sequent-Extraction,HetzlLeitschWellerPaleo2008Herbrand-Sequent-Extraction}, 
it is only necessary to remove cuts that contain quantifiers. 
This can be achieved with an easy modification of $\CERes$: 
in the construction of the characteristic formula and of the projections, 
ancestors of quantifier-free cuts should be treated in the same way 
as end-sequent ancestors.

Any of the previously defined variants of $\CERes$ can be modified in this
manner. When this is done, more axioms are mapped to $\bot$ in the
characteristic formula, and some inferences that were previously mapped to
conjunctions are now mapped to disjunctions. Consequently, fewer
distributions, redundant duplications and new predicate symbols are necessary.
This leads to smaller and more easily refutable clause sets.
