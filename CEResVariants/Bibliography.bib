  abstract = {Carrying out a suggestion by Kreisel, we adapt G{\"o}del's functional
	interpretation to ordinary first-order predicate logic(PL) and thus
	devise an algorithm to extract Herbrand terms from PL-proofs. The
	extraction is carried out in an extension of PL to higher types.
	The algorithm consists of two main steps: first we extract a functional
	realizer, next we compute the $\beta$-normal-form of the realizer
	from which the Herbrand terms can be read off. Even though the extraction
	is carried out in the extended language, the terms are ordinary PL-terms.
	In contrast to approaches to Herbrand's theorem based on cut elimination
	or $\varepsilon$-elimination this extraction technique is, except
	for the normalization step, of low polynomial complexity, fully modular
	and furthermore allows an analysis of the structure of the Herbrand
	terms, in the spirit of Kreisel, already prior to the normalization
	step. It is expected that the implementation of functional interpretation
	in Schwichtenberg's MINLOG system can be adapted to yield an efficient
	Herbrand-term extraction tool.},

	of Prolog</i> contains a number of important changes. Most background
	sections at the end of each chapter have been updated to take account
	of important recent research results, the references have been greatly
	expanded, and more advanced exercises have been added which have
	been used successfully in teaching the course.<br /> <br /> Part
	II, The Prolog Language, has been modified to be compatible with
	the new Prolog standard, and the chapter on program development has
	been significantly altered: the predicates defined have been moved
	to more appropriate chapters, the section on efficiency has been
	moved to the considerably expanded chapter on cuts and negation,
	and a new section has been added on stepwise enhancement -- a systematic
	way of constructing Prolog programs developed by Leon Sterling.<br
	/> <br /> All but one of the chapters in Part III, Advanced Prolog
	Programming Techniques, have been substantially changed, with some
	major rearrangements. A new chapter on interpreters describes a rule
	language and interpreter for expert systems, which better illustrates
	how Prolog should be used to construct expert systems. The chapter
	on program transformation is completely new and the chapter on logic
	grammars adds new material for recognizing simple languages, showing
	how grammars apply to more computer science examples.},

  title = {Handbook of Tableau Methods},
  publisher = {Springer},
  year = {1999},
  editor = {Marcello D'Agostino and Dov M. Gabbay and Reiner Hhnle and Joachim
	Posegga},
  abstract = {The tableau methodology, invented in the 1950's by Beth and Hintikka
	and later perfected by Smullyan and Fitting, is today one of the
	most popular proof theoretical methodologies. Firstly because it
	is a very intuitive tool, and secondly because it appears to bring
	together the proof-theoretical and the semantical approaches to the
	presentation of a logical system.
	
	The increasing demand for improved tableau methods for various logics
	is mainly prompted by extensive applications of logic in computer
	science, artificial intelligence and logic programming, as well as
	its use as a means of conceptual analysis in mathematics, philosophy,
	linguistics and in the social sciences.
	
	In the last few years the renewed interest in the method of analytic
	tableaux has generated a plethora of new results, in classical as
	well as non-classical logics. On the one hand, recent advances in
	tableau-based theorem proving have drawn attention to tableaux as
	a powerful deduction method for classical first-order logic, in particular
	for non-clausal formulas accommodating equality. On the other hand,
	there is a growing need for a diversity of non-classical logics which
	can serve various applications, and for algorithmic presentations
	of these logicas in a unifying framework which can support (or suggest)
	a meaningful semantic interpretation.
	
	From this point of view, the methodology of analytic tableaux seems
	to be most suitable. Therefore, renewed research activity is being
	devoted to investigating tableau systems for intuitionistic, modal,
	temporal and many-valued logics, as well as for new families of logics,
	such as non-monotonic and substructural logics.
	
	The results require systematisation. This Handbook is the first to
	provide such a systematisation of this expanding field. It contains
	several chapters on the use of tableaux methods in classical logic,
	but also contains extensive discussions on:
	
	 * the uses of the methodology in intuitionistic logics * modal and
	temporal logics * substructural logics, nonmonotonic and many-valued
	logics * the implementation of semantic tableaux * a bibliography
	on analytic tableaux theorem proving.
	
	The result is a solid reference work to be used by students and researchers
	in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics, Philosophy,
	Cognitive Sciences, Legal Studies, Linguistics, Engineering and all
	the areas, whether theoretical or applied, in which the algorithmic
	aspects of logical deduction play a role.},
